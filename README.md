# FFT
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

It is an algorithm which plays a very important role in the computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence. Fourier transofrm can be used as a tool for decomposing signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. FFT compute Fourier Transforms much faster than using the conventional method (FFT save some steps by reducing the number of calculations in DFT).
